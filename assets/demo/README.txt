Demo Images Directory
=====================

This directory should contain demo images for the seeded recipes.

Due to copyright considerations, actual food images are not included in this codebase.

To add demo images:
1. Find or create 12 food images (one for each demo recipe)
2. Name them: recipe-1.jpg, recipe-2.jpg, ..., recipe-12.jpg
3. Place them in this directory
4. Update the Seeder.php to attach these images to recipes

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Dimensions: At least 800x600px
- File size: Under 500KB each

Without images, recipes will still function but won't have featured images.
You can add images later via the WordPress admin interface.
